{{ site.title }} is a Tool to generating HTML-Code with template engine magic.  
There are some basic Themes and Codesnippets you can use and edit.  

### Help 

 1. Select a layout by double-click
 2. Edit the config
 3. generate HTML-Code

A lot of Themes has the same content like `title`, `name`, `age`, `gender`, so you can switch easier between themes.
