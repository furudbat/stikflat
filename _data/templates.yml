  description: Hello! This is a F2U profile code meant to work as a journal-type page
    for your oc! It's got a page for basic info and two pages for journal entries,
    although it shouldn't be too hard to add more of those. There's also space for
    a pagedoll/other graphic- I'd reccomend using a portait image for the best effect.
    It's responsive, and you're free to do what you'd like with it as long as you
    maintain credit!
